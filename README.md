### Data Analysis Repository ###
Projects on analysis of data conducted in class during my senior year in the economics program.

## COIL ##
The Collaborative Online International Learning project aims at developing cross-cultural skills and research capabilities with an international team. In our project, we were to come up with a data source and a question to answer at the end of the semester. Along with our colleagues from Thailand, we determined that we wanted to study the correlation between income and beer consumption. Using our theoretical and technical knowledge of statistics, we returned a very detailed and data oriented product using R Studio. Feel free to download report and take a look. I am very open to constructive criticism; let me know how we could have done better.

## Analysis on mortality rate and states' budget allocation for hospitals ##
A researcher is interested in the relationship between a state's mortality rate and its spending
on hospitals (and other health services). The data come from different sources such as the US Census, the Bureau
of Economic Analysis and the US Mortality Database. Check out the Mortality_and_Budget folder for all the files and the script generated for this project. This was my senior year final project for Econometrics.
