### Monte Carlo for alternating men and women in 5 chairs

count = 0
for (i in 1:nrep) {
  x = sample(5)
  if (x[1] * x[3] * x[5] == 15) count = count + 1
} # 15 is from the position of the odd numbers; odd = male
print(count/nrep)


### Monte Carlo simulating the probability of rolling a ten in 3 fair dice
nrep = 100000
count = 0
for (i in 1:nrep) {
  roll = sample(1:6, 3, replace = T)
  if (sum(roll) == 10) count = count + 1
}
print(count/nrep)


### Exercise 25.2
nrep = 100000
count = 0
for (i in 1:nrep){
  roll = sample(1:6, 6, replace = T) # 6 faces, 6 rolls. no replace
  if (roll == sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))) count = count + 1
  print(roll)
}
print(count/nrep)
#print(roll) # check the rolls for verification


### Exercise 25.3
nrep = 100000
count = 0
for (i in 1:nrep) {
  x = sample(c(rep('x', 40), c(rep('y', 10))))
  if (x == c('x', 'y', 'x')) count = count + 1
  print(x)
}

### Urn exercise
set.seed(4)
nrep = 100000
count = 0

urn1 = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1)

y = sample(5, 1) # set y as index of urn 2 ball picked
urn1[x] = urn2[y] # transfer from urn2 to urn1

### calculate 90th percentile between 2 points
nrep = 1000000
x1 = runif(nrep)
x2 = runif(nrep)
y1 = runif(nrep)
y2 = runif(nrep)
d = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)
sort(d)[0.9 * nrep] # sort results based on the 90th percentile
