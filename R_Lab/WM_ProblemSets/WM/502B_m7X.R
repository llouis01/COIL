### Monte Carlo for alternating men and women in 5 chairs
nrep = 100000
count = 0
for (i in 1:nrep) {
  x = sample(5)
  if (x[1] * x[3] * x[5] == 15) count = count + 1
} # 15 is from the position of the odd numbers; odd = male
print(count/nrep)


### Monte Carlo simulating the probability of roling a ten in 3 fair dice
nrep = 100000
count = 0
for (i in 1:nrep) {
  roll = sample(1:6, 3, replace = T)
  if (sum(roll) == 10) count = count + 1
}
print(count/nrep)


### Exercise 25.2
nrep = 100000
count = 0
for (i in 1:nrep){
  roll = sample(1:6, 6, replace = F)
  if (roll == c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) count = count + 1
}
print(count/nrep)
print(roll)


### Exercise 25.3
nrep = 100000
count = 0
for (i in 1:nrep){
  x = sample(1:10, 100)
  if (x == 3) count = count + 1
}
print(count/nrep)
